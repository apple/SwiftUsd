# ``OpenUSD/Overlay``
The namespace used to group workarounds to limitations in Swift-Cxx interop

## Discussion
This Swift Package uses the `Overlay` namespace to group workarounds to limitations in Swift-Cxx interop, as well as proposed additions to make OpenUSD in Swift feel more natural and easy to use. 

For example, see <doc:WrappedTypes> and <doc:DereferencingPointers>.
